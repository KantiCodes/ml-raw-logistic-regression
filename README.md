# ml-raw-logistic-regression
This notebook presents step by step implementation of a binary classifier for MNIST dataset, where we distinguish following classes(digits 0 and 1 are supposed to be removed from the dataset):
- Prime nubmers(2,3,5,7)
- Compound numbers(4,6,8,9)

The solution is going to:
 - Implement both **logistic regression** and optimization ***SGD + momentum*** using only **numpy**.
 - Tune the hyperparameters in order to increase the performance on test set.
 - Evaluate the model.
